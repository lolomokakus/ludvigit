#!/usr/bin/env bash
scrot -z /tmp/lock.png # take a screenshot (without beeping)
convert /tmp/lock.png -scale 10% -scale 1000% /tmp/lock.png # scale the image
# first, we scale the image down to 10% of its original size
# then, we scale it up to the original size (1000% of 10% is 100%)
# this gives the image a nice pixelated effect.
i3lock -b -u -i /tmp/lock.png # run the locker with the modified screenshot as a background image
# also disable the ugly password indicator ui (it beeps on incorrect password, that's all we need)
rm /tmp/lock.png # delete the image
